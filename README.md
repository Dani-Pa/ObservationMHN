# ObservationMHN
This is the repository for the manuscript "Overcoming Observation Bias for Cancer Progression Modeling". It contains the data and resulting models. 
The script ReproduceResults.py learns the models from the data. It requires the official MHN-package which can be installed with 
```bash
pip install mhn
```
The package is currently compatible with Python versions 3.8 to 3.11 but not yet with the most recent version 3.12.
